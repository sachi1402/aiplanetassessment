I am excited to submit my project for the AI Planet front-end development internship. I have created a submissions app that allows learners to submit their hackathon solutions and view the list of submissions.

I used ReactJS to build the app, creating multiple components instead of a single component. I also utilized React Router, Redux, and React Icon libraries. Though the styling may not be the same as the design mockups, all of the required features were implemented, including the ability for learners to create, edit, and delete their submissions.

Each submission form includes fields for the title, summary, description, cover image, hackathon name, hackathon start and end dates, Github repository link, and other optional links. Learners can also search for submissions by title and sort them based on hackathon start date (oldest, newest).

The app has two tabs: "All submissions" and "Favourite submissions". When a submission is clicked, learners can view all the data related to it, edit or delete the submission, and mark it as a favorite by clicking on the star icon. All favorite submissions are visible in the "Favourite submissions" tab.

I utilized TypeScript in my implementation, which I believe adds to the efficiency and modularity of the code.

The code for the project is available on my GitHub repository, and I have also hosted the app on the internet for easy access. I hope my submission meets all the requirements and impresses the AI Planet team. Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skills and passion for front-end development.
